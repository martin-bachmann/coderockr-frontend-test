# Coderockr Front-End Test

App created as part of the selection process for Coderockr. It was required to develop a front-end application that feeds on an api to show posts on a page with infinite scroll. The following tools were used:

**React**: library that assists in creating efficient and interactive front-end applications. I chose this library because it facilitated the development in the indicated time and because I had experience with it from the projects I did while I was a student at Trybe.

## To start and run the project
```bash
npm install
npm start
``` 

## To run the tests
```bash
npm run test
```
